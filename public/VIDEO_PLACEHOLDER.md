# Hero Video

The hero video file `hero-video.mp4` is not included in this repository due to its large size (109MB).

## Options:

1. **Use a CDN**: Upload the video to a CDN like Cloudinary, Vimeo, or YouTube and update the video source in `src/components/Hero.tsx`

2. **Use Git LFS**: If you want to keep the video in the repo, use Git Large File Storage

3. **Replace with smaller video**: Compress the video or use a shorter clip

4. **Use placeholder**: For now, the site will work without the video, just showing a fallback background
